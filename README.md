The project involves the study of a railway bridge from the mechanical point of view. The report is self explicative and all the Matlab code is written there. The contents are:
- Definition of a FE model
- Computation of the natural frequencies and modes of vibrations
- Computation of a FRF considering an input force with Bode diagrams
- Computation of a model in modal cordinates of the FRF
- Computation of a FRF considering an input moment with Bode diagrams
- Study of a bridge response to a seismic motion of the ground
- Redefinition of the structure with new mechanical / cost goals

A .inp file is also added, used for the first point.
